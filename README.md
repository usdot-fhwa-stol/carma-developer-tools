# Internal Tools & Utilities Repository

Welcome to the **Internal Tools & Utilities** repository! This repository is designed to collect and organize scripts, tools, and utilities developed by our team members for various testing and internal-use cases. While these tools may not be peer-reviewed or ready for public release, they offer valuable functionality and can aid in development processes, testing scenarios, and other internal projects.

---

## üìã Purpose

This repository serves as a holding area for **non-peer-reviewed** code that is useful enough to be shared with team members rather than hidden in a branch. Here, developers can find tools and scripts created for specific testing purposes, development convenience, or internal projects that may not yet meet release standards. The content here may serve as:

- **Quick Solutions:** Handy tools that simplify specific tasks or automate repetitive workflows.
- **Testing Utilities:** Scripts and code snippets used to simulate or test specific scenarios in our applications.
- **Internal Documentation:** References or utility functions that might otherwise remain undocumented or inaccessible.
  
> **Note:** This repository is not intended for code that will be directly deployed or shared externally without additional review and development.

## üö© Disclaimer

**This code is provided ‚Äúas-is‚Äù** and may not meet production standards. It has not been formally reviewed, and as such, users are advised to use it with caution and understand that issues or bugs may be present. It is meant solely for internal use within the team.

## üîß Repository Structure
Each folder holds code for specific product or projects. Such as:
- **`/carma-platform/`**: ROS nodes or tools for testing and debugging carma-platform.
- **`/voices/`**: Scripts or helper code for VOICES developing or demonstration.
...

## üõ† Usage

Each directory may contain its own README file for specific details on usage, dependencies, and limitations. Users are encouraged to review any notes or comments in the code before running it, as certain scripts may require configuration or setup specific to our environment. Please make sure to indicate when or which version did the code apply to.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions to this repository should adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Document** your code as clearly as possible.
2. **Comment** any unusual logic or dependencies.
3. Ensure that any sensitive or secure information (such as passwords, tokens, or secrets) is not included.
4. Update any related README files within the directory to help others understand the purpose and usage of the tool.

Contributions are welcomed but should be made with the understanding that this code is not intended for official release and does not require formal review unless specifically requested.
